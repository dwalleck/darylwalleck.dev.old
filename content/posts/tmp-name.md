## Opening

I came across this post on Twitter a few weeks ago which really made me think:

"Does reporting to a QA/test manager vs. a non-QA/test manager affect your
career growth? @ckenst says, our career growth is in our own hands, though a
manager can help with support for it. #StateOfTesting panel"

This kicked off an afternoon of reflection on my career so far and the people
and events that have both accelerated and stagnated my growth during my time
in testing. Managers do have a direct and important role to play in our
day-to-day growth, but there's other factors that are just as important that are
in and out of our control. Before I rush too far ahead, I wanted to step back
and think about what characteristics of a great leader are.

## What should I expect from my leader

### Genuinely interested in you and your career growth

This sounds basic, but it's critical. While it would be nice if our leaders were
also our best buds, at the very least they should be taking the time to
understand you and where you'd like your career to go. This is the basic
information they need to help you with the next point.

### Sets goals that stretch your current knowledge and comfort

Okay, not all leaders like setting goals for their reports, but having them
creates a measurable way to know how you're progressing. It's also good if an
outsider sets at least some of your goals since they have an outside perspective
on your current abilities. Insightful leaders have a good idea of where their
reports limits are and can set goals _just_ above your current abilities to push
your growth along.

### Gives you the space to fail but the grace to correct your mistakes

Regardless of how much people tell me how smart I am, I know where most of the
important lessons I've learned came from: failure. Failure comes in all kinds
of flavors:
    - Arrogance (I can succeed where others have failed!)
    - Poor estimation (this whole feature set? One week, tops!)
    - Boiling the ocean (I can start working just as soon as I've found the
      solution to...everything)
It can be painful to watch, but sometimes when a report is deadset on a decision
that will likely not end well is to let the situation play out. It's a hard
lesson in teaching risk management. If we are never allowed to fail, how careful
will we be later when someone isn't watching our shoulders?

### Articulates your accomplishments clearly to others

It's not as important for your leader to know exactly how your latest amazing
solution works. It's more important that they know how to explain its impact
to others. Saying "So-so is the best! They always do great work!" is not nearly
as impactful as "Alice came up with the most amazing solution! It made the
foo process way more reliable and run 20% faster!".

- Will give you honest but constructive feedback
- Listens, understands, and acts on your concerns when possible
- Acts in your best interest over theirs

- Can articulate your accomplishments in clear and meanful ways to their peers
  and leadership
